i don't know what the build cmd would be for windows so that's why there's only a .sh file provided
the provided windows wrapper is untested but i will test it whenever i feel like it lmao

i didn't use cmake or anything because i don't feel like setting all of that up
for a simple wrapper over libvlc functions!

no macOS support because      i don't have a mac bro!
