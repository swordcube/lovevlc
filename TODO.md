# TODO
[ ] audio support via OpenAL
[ ] wrap into love.graphics.newVideo (use default impl for ogv videos)
[ ] wrap into love.graphics.newVideoStream (maybe, might just make this function throw an error, use default impl for ogv videos)

[ ] windows support (vlc instance is null, which is really strange and should not happen)
[ ] macOS support
